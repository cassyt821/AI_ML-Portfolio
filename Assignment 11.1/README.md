In this assignment I explored a used car dataset from Kaggle to determine what consumers want in a car. I assumed that features that could be used to predict a higher car price are good indicators of what consumers want or are willing to buy. Based on this work, I identified a few actionable insights.

In general, the following categories of cars seem to be popular with customers:

- old cars on their last legs, likely to be used for parts or restoration
- large cars that are robust and reliable for off-roading or driving in areas with less road infrastructure. The less wear-and-tear on the car, the better.
- SUVs. Customers are more willing to pay for well-maintained or newer SUVs and are ok if they have been moderately used.
- Small, powerful cars, like sports cars.
- White cars are also generally good to keep around.

Chevrolet, Toyota, and Ford cars are predominant in this dataset, so these findings are likely to be more heavily influenced by these manufacturers' cars compared to cars manufactured by other companies.
