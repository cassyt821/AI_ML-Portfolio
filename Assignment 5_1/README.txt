In this project, I explored the groups of individuals who are likely to accept coupons of two specific types: Bar Coupons and Coffee House Coupons.

The 

Bar Findings:

Drivers who already regularly frequented bars (more than once a month on average) were predisposed to accepting the offered coupons. The likelihood of a driver accepting a bar coupon increased as the conditions were narrowed: among drivers who routinely visited bars, those who had passengers who were not kids or who were under the age of 30 were more likely than not to accept the coupon. 

The likelihood of accepting the bar coupons decreased significantly when drivers who frequent cheap restaurants and make less than $50,000 were offered the coupon.

Looking at coupon acceptance at the cross-section of age and bar frequency, it seems that the relationship between age, pre-existing bar patronage, and coupon acceptance needs to be further explored, and the segment to target may change slightly depending on whether the goal is to invite a driver to try a new establishment or invite them back to a familiar one.
